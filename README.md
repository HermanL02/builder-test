# Koii Network Builder Test Repository

## Project Overview

### Purpose
This repository is a test environment for Koii Network builders, designed to demonstrate and explore the capabilities of the Koii Network's decentralized infrastructure and tools.

### Key Features
- Experimental sandbox for Koii Network development
- Test environment for blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) builders
- Provides a starting point for exploring Koii Network's technologies

## Repository Structure

### Directories
At present, the repository contains minimal files:
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
- `README.md`: Project documentation and overview

### Planned Structure
As this is a builder test repository, the structure may evolve to include:
- `/src`: Source code for sample applications or tools
- `/docs`: Detailed documentation and usage guides
- `/examples`: Sample implementations and use cases

## Technical Details

### Technologies
- **Blockchain**: Koii Network
- **Primary Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript (potential)
- **Development Environment**: Decentralized application (dApp) development sandbox

### Architecture
- Decentralized infrastructure
- Permissionless development framework
- Focuses on builder experimentation and learning
